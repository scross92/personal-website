Shaun Cross is a CIHMID postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University (https://cihmid.cornell.edu/). He is advised by Drs. John Parker and Iwijn De Vlaminck. His research focuses on elucidating rotavirus-host interactions (in vivo) using single-cell RNAseq and spatial transcriptomics. He completed his graduate work under the direction of Dr. Mark Stenglein studying virome constituents in medically relevant arthropods: Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Ixodes scapularis (deer tick), and Aedes aegypti (yellow fever mosquito).
